# Password-Generator
This program is a random password generator.  The request was to refactor (broken)nominal JS code to create an application that enables one to generate random passwords that can use uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. I did noto create or adjust the HTML file or CSS. I may do that on an upgraded version of this program. 

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Here's a mock up:
